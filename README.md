# Guitar Google Doodle
The plan so far is to use one of many guitar vectors I'm iterating in Figma and have it either levitate/float just above the ground as seen in a Codepen guitar animation I like or have it on a stand.
- Goal is to be able to click on it and the strings and/or guitar vibrates producing quick little animations of notes, bolts, stars, etc to express sounds in action
- For to be effective: Hi-Contrast colors, clean vectors (so far so good) and a small amplifier to the left or right.
- "Google" lettering will have to be appropriate font (still looking)
- "Google" will be in center w/guitar on Left and amp on Right

# Guitar Google Doodle
The plan so far is to use one of many guitar vectors I'm iterating in Figma and have it either levitate/float just above the ground as seen in a Codepen guitar animation I like or have it on a stand.
- Goal is to be able to click on it and the strings and/or guitar vibrates producing quick little animations of notes, bolts, stars, etc to express sounds in action
*New* Hi-Contrast colors chosen from svgs mock-ups in Figma: #Stage = Hi-Sat Blue #66FCF1, w/contrasting lettering in Hi-Sat Pink #FF007F 
*New* "Google" lettering chosen based (after svg conversion) on retro 80s font called Arcade Machine (markup annotated)
- "Google" will be in center w/guitar on Left and amp on Right (DONE)

- Next steps: Start bringing it to life! Want to have the strings vibrate when clicked on and then - somehow - have a bolt of energy stream from the guitar through the word Google which is large and centered and then activate the "MegaStack" amplifier w/little bolts & stars bursting outward in arc over the amp and upwards

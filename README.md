# Guitar Google Doodle
The plan so far is to use one of many guitar vectors I'm iterating in Figma and have it either levitate/float just above the ground as seen in a Codepen guitar animation I like or have it on a stand.

- Goal is to be able to click on it and the strings and/or guitar vibrates producing quick little animations of notes, bolts, stars, etc to express sounds in action
*New* Hi-Contrast colors chosen from svgs mock-ups in Figma: #Stage = Hi-Sat Blue #66FCF1, w/contrasting lettering in Hi-Sat Pink #FF007F 
*New* "Google" lettering chosen based (after svg conversion) on retro 80s font called Arcade Machine (markup annotated)
    *Note* The guitar and amplifier stack svgs were designed by myself in Ai and Figma

- "Google" will be in center w/guitar on Left and amp on Right (DONE)

- Next/Setup Tasks To-Do ASAP: 
    Edit SVGs so each element has an InternalCSS Style Name that can be targeted for Transitions and Animations using CSS and/or Js
    "GOOGLE" Head (large, centered in #Stage) DONE
    "Play Me!" Head (Med, Upper L-Hand Corner #Stage) DONE
    "MegaStack" Guitar Amplifier Stack (Large, R-Hand Side #Stage) - Used Figma Plugin [link to figma svgs with unique ids plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/804532959937451122/SVG-code-with-unique-links-ids) 
    
    or used illustrator w/export setting 

    "FlyingV" Guitar (Large, L-Hand Side #Stage) Need Edit in Ai - PENDING

# Guitar Google Doodle
The plan so far is to use one of many guitar vectors I'm iterating in Figma and have it either levitate/float just above the ground as seen in a Codepen guitar animation I like or have it on a stand.

TASKS / UPDATES LOG:
* Hi-Contrast colors chosen from svgs mock-ups in Figma: #Stage = Hi-Sat Blue #66FCF1, w/contrasting lettering in Hi-Sat Pink #FF007F 
* "Google" lettering chosen based (after svg conversion) on retro 80s font called Arcade Machine (markup annotated)
* The guitar and amplifier stack svgs were designed in Ai and Figma based on real Amps (Marshalls) & Gibson FlyingV (all elements to scale)

Tasks: 
* #GOOGLE centered w/#FlyingV on Left and #MegaStack on Right (DONE)
Edit SVG's layers to target for animations and FX (DONE)
    Used Figma Plugin [link to figma svgs with unique ids plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/804532959937451122/SVG-code-with-unique-links-ids) 
    
    or used illustrator w/export setting 
* #FlyingV Floating (DONE)
* #FlyingV Pulsing w/energy (lots options, working)
* #GOOGLE Pulse of energy from #FlyingV - thru each letter (hopefully) - to #MegaStack
    ! Will need a DELAY of this from the initial page load of 1-2s 
* #MegaStack Energy Pulse like others BUT MUST HAVE DELAY of ~2-3s for LEFT TO RIGHT FLOW energy from #FlyingV thru #GOOGLE & appear to activate #MegaStack
